# Number of adapters dedicated to ffdecsawrapper
# Maximum is 4 because max 8 adapters are permitted in your system.
# (4 real + 4 loopback) If you need more, like me, recompile your kernel.
# So if you have 2 adapters, you need to set "-j a:c -j b:d" in JOIN=" "

# Number of seconds delay you need before (re)loading dvbloopback and other components.
# On Debian 2 or 3 is fine

# Combine (some of) your real adapters with loopback adapters
# Example: assuming you have 5 real adapters installed in your system
# The first two of them are in use with Tvheadend or some other program
# Number 3, 4 and 5 will be used by MythTV
# Then you should set: -j 2:5 -j 3:6 -j 4:7

# Other options to pass to ffdecsawrapper
# N.B.: One user reported that --buffer 8M works, and --buffer 16M crashes ffdecsawrapper.
# This probably has something to do with the (lack of) 'vmalloc' settings in /etc/default/grub.
# But I did not test it yet.
