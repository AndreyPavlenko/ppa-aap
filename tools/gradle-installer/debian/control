Description: Groovy based build system
 Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for 
 multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and 
 deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can 
 support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to 
 publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation 
 across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, 
 and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous 
 integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.
